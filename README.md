## Description

Welcome to the [Full Stack Developer Community](https://fullstackdevelopercommunity.herokuapp.com/) where web developers can come together to learn, or contribute to the web developement community! Whether you are new to web development, or are an experienced web developer, this site allows the user the ability to **Login** or **Sign Up** to create their own posts, or view other developers posts by technology. Once logged in the user can use their **Dashboard** to upload a profile picture, enter information about themselves and post their own content (including videos). From the **Home** page they can view all of the avaialble technologies and choose one to view the content for that technology. There is a **Donate** page for members to financially contribute to the [Full Stack Developer Community](https://fullstackdevelopercommunity.herokuapp.com/) and the web developers who use it.
